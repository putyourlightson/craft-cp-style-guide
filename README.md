# CP Style Guide Plugin for Craft CMS 3

The CP Style Guide plugin provides a style guide for control panel pages in [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/). It helps you when designing and building your plugin's control panel pages by providing markup and twig template tags for generating native elements and form fields in Craft.
